## Definitions

#### Abstraction

> In computer science, Abstraction refers to the process of hiding complex implementation details while providing a simplified view of a system or program to its users. It is a fundamental concept in computer programming, design, and analysis, and is used to manage complexity and improve software design.

>Abstraction is achieved by defining a clear boundary between different parts of a system, such that users interact with the system through well-defined interfaces, rather than through the underlying implementation details. This allows users to focus on the higher-level functionality of the system without worrying about the low-level details.
>
>There are various types of abstraction in computer science, such as data abstraction, procedural abstraction, and control abstraction. Data abstraction involves defining abstract data types and operations on them, while procedural abstraction involves grouping related operations into functions or procedures. Control abstraction involves abstracting control flow constructs, such as loops and conditional statements.
>
>Overall, abstraction is an important tool for managing complexity in computer systems and is used extensively in software development to improve software design, maintainability, and scalability.

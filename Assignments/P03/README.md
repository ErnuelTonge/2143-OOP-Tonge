## P03 - Graphviz Class
### Ernuel Tonge
### Description:

       This program implements a class that will generate graphviz "dot" syntax to facilitate 
       the visualization of output for various data structures. Graphviz is used for "graph 
       visualization" and provides a simple way to visualize linked data structures. The  
       program allows the user to add Nodes and Edges initialized with default attributes  
       stored in a map,and then if desired edit or update these attributes for each selected 
       Node or Edge. These are then Printed in graphviz "dot" syntax as  simple connected  
       Nodes, as a Linked List, as a Doubly Linked List, or a Binary Search Tree. This class  
       only implements a small portion of the features that Graphviz offers and the output 
       is then pasted into the online Graphviz editor.
